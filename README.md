# IGDemo

1. The project is based on BDD Cucumber framework.
2. Test Report is also generated using maven-fire-plugins.
3. All the jars are automatically download because on Maven pom.xml
4. Used Junit for unit testing and assertions and verifying each and every method.
5. Many things afe hard coded as I was facing some issues with the eclipse and due to time crunch, I know many things can be moved into particular util files and resources but due to lack of time I was not able to perform
6. Still I manage to cover all the Use cases as required, which I guess will work
